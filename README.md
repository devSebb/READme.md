## 👋 Hello, I'm SEB
I'm a software developer driven by the belief that we are in a new era of coding—one where the barriers that once guarded this field are being dismantled. The world of software development is no longer exclusive; it's becoming a space where anyone who wants to code, can code. I am one of those people.

## 🌱 My Journey
I discovered my love for coding during the AI revolution, around the time GPT-3 was making waves. My journey began with a failed startup, a venture that pushed me to learn to code so I could independently build and maintain my ideas. Over the past couple of years, this journey has transformed into a passion. I’ve realized that coding, designing, and creating are not just skills I’ve acquired—they’re what I want to dedicate my time to.

## 💡 What Drives Me
I’m passionate about the impact technology can have on our world. Working in this industry, I feel a unique sense of belonging and freedom. It's one of the few places profesional work areas where I truly feel at home. The internet is a vast space where we can architect even the smallest pieces to make a difference. If there’s a feature to build, a task to complete, or a new language to master, I’m all in. I code because it gives me the power to create something meaningful, no matter how small and dream about creating something big, no matter how **Big**.

## 🌟 My Vision
I want to be part of teams that are making a real difference, in industries that influence our daily lives or pushes us to create better produts. Whether it’s improving user experiences, contributing to innovative projects, or tackling new challenges, I'm eager to dive in. The tech world is where I get to feel free, where my mind can roam and create.

## 🌐 Why I'm Here
I'm seeking opportunities to work with teams that share this vision. Companies that are not just about coding for coding’s sake but about making an impact. I want to be where my work contributes to something bigger than myself, where every line of code is a step towards shaping a better digital future. I specialize in front-end features, but have my fair share of experience with backend techonologies like Rails, Mongo DB, Postgres SQL, Node/React/JS. I have experience in **Animation** using tools like anime.js and GSAP. As well as creting simple animations in Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap and others. 

I have confidente that with the right time, I can be extremely useful in creating products and long lasting companies that will help the future of great areas of the world. Im interested in many industries and have been largely polymath in my past. Dwellving in various industries such as Corporate Finance, Real estate, Stock Day Trading, Sports Betting, Web3, dropshipping and others. Finding my way into the sides of the internet. 

Now, I am taking steps to become one developer of influence. Not due to his persona, but due to his work in the tech industry.
